        <div class="mainPageContent">
    Chicago Code Camp is a free, community-driven developer conference. We had 500 people registered last year, with over 35 sessions! Over 200 attendees and 17 sponsors filled the campus of College of Lake County this previous year. This year will be even better than last year. We're still hosted by College of Lake County - which will accomodate our ever growing attendance with room to spare.
        <br /><br />
        Join us for the sixth annual Chicago Code Camp at the College of Lake County campus on April 26th, 2014 for even more first-rate developer content.
